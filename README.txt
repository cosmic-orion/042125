Remi Scrapbook - quick notes
----------------------------

How to preview:
1. Unzip this folder.
2. Open index.html in your browser (double-click).

How to edit:
- Photos: put your photos in the 'images' folder. Rename them to photo1.jpg, photo2.jpg, etc. or update the <img> tags.
- Text: open the HTML files (index.html, story.html, letter.html, gallery.html, links.html) in a text editor (Notepad, VSCode, etc.) and edit the text.
- Colors & fonts: open css/style.css and edit the variables at the top (--paper, --accent, etc.).
- Spotify playlists: the embedded players update automatically when you change the playlist on Spotify. To change the playlists used, edit the iframe src in links.html (use the /embed/playlist/{playlist-id} path).
- To add more sections: create a new HTML file and link it from the nav in index.html.

Notes:
- The music flap is collapsible: click the "Tap to open playlists" button to show/hide the players.
- If a photo is missing, images/placeholder.jpg will show automatically.
